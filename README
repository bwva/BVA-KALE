BVA-KALE

Extensible user interface

KALE is an evolution from a private set of modules under the BVA::XUI namespace.

BVA::XUI provides a versatile means of collecting, storing, and presenting information.

XUI objects are capable of requesting and accepting input from files, std input, http, and customizable modes.

XUI objects can provide outputs in std output, text files, Excel workbooks, html, json, pdf, rtf, and customizable formats.

BVA::XUI has been in use only in private installations, in some Internet website back-ends and in some data analysis libraries.

BVA::XUI has been in continuous develeopment beginning in 2001; the version on GitHub initially is 3.6_001, dated 2013-03-31. I will be committing several changes soon reflecting further development through 2013.

The KALE project seeks to bring XUI up to current standards for publication as open source. The work entails:
- Bring the code base to current best practices;
- Add flexible use of newer Perl version capabilities where available;
- Convert comments and separate instruction files to POD;
- Convert "sanity checks" and separate test scripts to standard suite of tests;
- Assemble KALE distribution for CPAN.

KALE takes its name from the kale (kohl) family of plants (the Brassicas), so many of which provide nourishment to people around the world - cabbage, broccoli, kale, collard greens, cauliflower, brussels sprouts, kohlrabi. Each of these is a variation on the same basic plant, but each one extends its growth and stores its energy in a unique part of the plant's structure. Cauliflower tops short stems with massive flowers, broccoli has longer stems and still lots of storage in the flower; cabbage no stems, everything in the tightly nested leaves. That's the idea of the KALE module: the basic system works fine, and it has many parts you can expand as needed for your application.

[This description will be expanded as I bring in the documentation.]
